</a>

First, you need to install the `multi-avatars` component package, here you run

```sh
npm i multi-avatars
```

Then, in your React app, import the `avataaars ` and `multi-avatars` component and put it where you like it to be, for example

```sh
import Avatars from "multi-avatars";

export default function App() {
  return (
      <Avatars
        avatarStyle={[true, 500]}
        topType={[true, 1000]}
        accessoriesType={[true, 1200]}
        //facialHairType={[true,500]}
        //facialHairType={[true,500]}
        clothesType={[true, 500]}
        clothesColorType={[true, 1000]}
        eyeType={[true]}
        eyebrow={[true, 2000]}
        mouthType={[true, 1200]}
        skinType={["Brown"]}
      />
  );
}
```

## expalin the code: ðŸ‘€

- The first of these is **true** which gives random avatars parts.
- The second refers to the number of **milliseconds** to give / change random avatars parts.

- Maybe if you only gave true then Avatars will give only once and it will not change after that.
Those parts will change only if you give the second millisecond.

#### For example:

```sh
eyeType={[true]}
```

- the `eyeType` only does not change as the above avatar is given only true in eyeType.

```sh
skinType = {["Brown"]
```

- And if you do not want to change a part of something you can give it(value) directly.
Look at the skin color of the avatar in the picture above...

> value = **Brown**

- If you do not give a props something will probably take its default value.

- But `facialHairType` only will not appear in the avatar unless you use it alone.

```sh
// facialHairType={[true,500]} // if don't wand this field (facialHair), so u do not use this
```
